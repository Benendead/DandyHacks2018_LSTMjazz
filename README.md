# LSTMjazz
## Summary
This is an ongoing project working to use LSTMs to generate novel jazz improvisations over given chord progressions.

### Date
Started at the DandyHacks 2018 hackathon in October 2018. Continuing into present.

### Goals
My main goal with this project is to familiarize myself with concepts involved with LSTM networks, continue to build my Keras 
capabilities, and to truly end up with some interesting music that may or may not end up actually being enjoyable.
Along the way, I'm familiarizing myself with the Music21 library for Python in order to process my dataset.

### Process
Continuing to process the data as I figure out Music21's inner workings. Currently extrapolating the chords from each song.

### Project's Result
Ongoing...

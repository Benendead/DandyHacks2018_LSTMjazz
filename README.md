# LSTMjazz
## Summary
This is an ongoing project working to use LSTMs to generate novel jazz improvisations over given chord progressions.

### Date
Started at the DandyHacks 2018 hackathon in October 2018. Continuing into present.

### Goals
My main goal with this project is to familiarize myself with concepts involved with LSTM networks, continue to build my Keras 
capabilities, and to truly end up with some interesting music that may or may not end up actually being enjoyable.
Along the way, I'm familiarizing myself with the Music21 library for Python in order to process my dataset.

### Process
Data preprocessing is now finished. I've studied the basic intuitions of LSTMs and am currently reading research papers to 
survey previous work into music generation using LSTMs.

### Project's Result
Ongoing...
